# merege_idb

It's very fun when two or more Reversers work together on one project, × ut IDA PRO doesn't support that.

So this is where this  script come into the picture - it's scans your .idb dump file and update any IDA instance

# usage

user_1 open his idb, and run the script, the script creating user_1_db_dump.p

user_2 append the user_1_db_dump to idb folder, and run the script.

user_1 take the user_2_db_dump and make the same like user_2

Good luck
