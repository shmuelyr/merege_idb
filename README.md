# merege_idb

It's very fun when two or more Reversers work together on one project, but IDA PRO have a big problem with it..

so, this script just pass over your IDA, dump useful info and, with this dump you can update any IDA instance.

# using

user_1 open your idb, and run the script
the script create dump user_1_db_dump.p

user_2 append the user_1_db_dump to idb folder, and run the script.

user_1 take the user_2_db_dump and make the same like user_2

Good luck
